      <p>I had a task to make websites for my company and project. I didn't know anything about making websites. I made two websites in WORDPRESS. After that, I made some landing pages in HTML and CSS for project platform. I fell in love with creating and developing websites. Because of that, I decided to go to the programming world.
        I am so motivated and want to become frontend developer and change my career.<br>
